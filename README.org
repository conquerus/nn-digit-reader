* Handwritten digit detection
** Overview
This program uses machine learning to predict handwritten digits in
real time. The multi-layer perceptrons neural network model is used and is
implemented using the Python library [[https://keras.io/][Keras]], which uses [[https://www.tensorflow.org/][Tensorflow]] as
the backend. The [[http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/][MNIST database]] of handwritten digits is used to train
the model.
** Installation and Use
*** Requirements
 1. Keras for the machine learning
 2. Pillow for image processing
 3. Numpy for data manipulation
 4. Pygame for the GUI and drawing tools
See [[file:./requirements.txt][requirements.txt]] for more details.
*** Training the model
To train the model run ~python ./src/MLP_model.py~. The model will be saved
in the =./model= and =./weights= directories.
*** Reading a digit from a file
To predict a digit from an image file (=./data/number.jpg=) run ~python
./src/read_digit.py~. If you would like to replace it with your own
file make sure the format and size are consistent with the example.
*** Drawing a digit
To predict a digit as you draw it run ~python ./src/gui.py~. Draw by
holding down the left mouse button, the prediction will be made
whenever you lift the mouse button. Clear the screen by pressing the
right mouse button.
** Example
Here is an example of the program predicting the handwritten digits
from 0-9. It does well for the most part.

In this example you can see how the prediction changes as more detail
to the digit is added. Since the program predicts in real-time as the
digit is being drawn it is quite fun to play around with.
